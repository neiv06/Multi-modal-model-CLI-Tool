# CLI Tool
Experimented with CLIP and open_clip in Python and implemented a zero-shot image classification program that outputs image-text similarity scores. Developed a command line tool that reads text prompts from the command line and outputs matching scores for each image in a local directory, along with displaying four images with the highest similarity scores to the prompt.
